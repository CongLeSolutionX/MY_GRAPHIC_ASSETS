## Radar Diagram (v11.6.0+)


## Introduction

A radar diagram is a simple way to plot low-dimensional data in a circular format.

It is also known as a **radar chart**, **spider chart**, **star chart**, **cobweb chart**, **polar chart**, or **Kiviat diagram**.

## Usage

This diagram type is particularly useful for developers, data scientists, and engineers who require a clear and concise way to represent data in a circular format.

It is commonly used to graphically summarize and compare the performance of multiple entities across multiple dimensions.

## Syntax

```md
radar-beta
axis A, B, C, D, E
curve c1{1,2,3,4,5}
curve c2{5,4,3,2,1}
... More Fields ...
```

## Examples

````
```mermaid
---
title: "Grades"
---
radar-beta
  axis m["Math"], s["Science"], e["English"]
  axis h["History"], g["Geography"], a["Art"]
  curve a["Alice"]{85, 90, 80, 70, 75, 90}
  curve b["Bob"]{70, 75, 85, 80, 90, 85}

  max 100
  min 0
```
````

```mermaid
---
title: "Grades"
---
radar-beta
  axis m["Math"], s["Science"], e["English"]
  axis h["History"], g["Geography"], a["Art"]
  curve a["Alice"]{85, 90, 80, 70, 75, 90}
  curve b["Bob"]{70, 75, 85, 80, 90, 85}

  max 100
